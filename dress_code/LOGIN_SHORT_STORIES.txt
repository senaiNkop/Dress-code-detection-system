Sunday Akpan was a student who loved to show off his unique fashion sense. He would often wear brightly colored clothing and flashy accessories to class. But one day, when he walked into class wearing a shirt with a questionable slogan, the software kicked in and sent an alert to the principal. Needless to say, Sunday learned his lesson and stuck to more appropriate clothing in the future.
Tuochi was always forgetful when it came to her attire. One day, she showed up to school wearing slippers instead of her usual sneakers. The software quickly caught her mistake and sent her a notification reminding her to check her outfit before leaving the house.
Michael was notorious for wearing clothing that was too tight and revealing. The software picked up on this and sent him a gentle reminder to dress appropriately for school. To his surprise, the message came with a funny meme that made him laugh and see the importance of dressing modestly.
Ebuka Edward loved to wear hoodies with the hoods up, even when it was hot outside. The software detected that his face was obscured and sent him a reminder to remove his hood. When he complied, he found a humorous message waiting for him that said "Better now?"
Edidiong had a habit of wearing mismatched socks to school. The software noticed this and sent her a playful message reminding her that "It's not opposite day!"
Ndifreke was a practical joker who loved to wear silly hats and costumes to school. The software picked up on his shenanigans and sent him a message that read "We love your creativity, but please save the costumes for Christmas!"
Beatrice was a fan of wearing oversized t-shirts and baggy pants to school. The software detected that her outfit was potentially hazardous and sent her a warning to dress more safely. The message came with a funny video of people tripping over their clothing.
Utibe was a bit of a rebel who liked to push the limits of the school's dress code. When the software detected that his shorts were too short, it sent him a message that said "We're not at the beach yet, Utibe!"
Affiong loved to wear bold makeup and accessories to school. The software detected that her earrings were too distracting and sent her a reminder to keep it simple. The message came with a funny GIF of a person struggling to carry a stack of books while wearing heavy jewelry.
Stanley was always cold and loved to wear a heavy coat to school. The software detected that he was breaking a rule against wearing coats in class and sent him a message that said "We know you're chilly, but let's keep the coats at home, okay?".
